Type Casting (primitive data types):
	Type casting is converting one data type to another data type.
	for example we can convert a short to byte a long to float etc.
	There are two main types implicit/widening/automatic and explicit/narrowing/manual 
Implicit/widening/automatic type casing:
	when java converts the data types automatically for us. It only happens when we assign 
	a smaller data type to a larger data type.because there is no data loss in this
	conversion.
explicit/narrowing/manual type casing:
	when we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type it is called 
	Explicit/narrowing/manual. it does not happen automatically. we have to do it explicitly manually.
Why we should learn type casting?
	when we write code in our real life most of the time we use code 
	from others to save the time and we might also need to convert to data type to makes 
	our codes compatible with their code. 
what is syntax for type casting.
	we use () and inside () we write the destination data type for example 
	if we want to convert a long to an int this is how we can do it.
	long var1=250;
	int var1=(int)var1; // its explicit/narrowing/manual. 
	double var3=var2; // Implicit/widening/automatic
	
	float f=250.5f; 
	double d=f; // Implicit/widening/automatic

If else conditions 
	If else conditions help us write code that can take the decision based on data. 
	because when we are solving a real life problem like testing a web site 
	our programs need to make a lot of decisions.
